    that accepts options from users and suggests which one they should
    go for.Being my first app, it took me about a month to complete.
    I was so exicted learning new stuffs. With Flipper I learnt about React components,
    lifecycle methods,stateless functional components and webpack to mention a few.<br/><br/>

    This is an Optical Character Recognition software interface
    that allows users to upload pictures to convert to text or capture with their webcam/mobile camera.
    I built this with pure Html CSS and JavaScript. Then, I had no idea what frame works or libraries were, lol.
    it still has some bugs but I left them intentionally to know how far I've come<br/> <br/>

    Here is my first ever personal website. I spent about a week building this with Bootstrap.
    Bootstrap made everything do easy, by just specifying a class on an element you could make it responsive.
    It was a chilling adventure but at a point I realized I couldn't do this myself without the help of Bootsrap.
    so I had to go back to learn CSS the hard way, and at the end, it paid off<br/><br/>

     I built covid19-today during the coronavirus pandemic. As a developer at that time,
     one of the ways I could help people was provide them with relevant information.
     It displays data on the spread of the virus for all affected countries, 
     with the country of the userscoming up first. Data provided include, daeth count, total confirmed cases
     total deaths, new cases and the likes.<br/><br/>
