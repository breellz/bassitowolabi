    Flipper is a simple web application 
    that accepts options from users and suggests which one they should
    choose. <span role="img" aria-label="wink">😉</span>
    Being my first app, it took me about a month to complete. <span role="img" aria-label="crying">😭</span>
    I was so exicted learning new stuffs.<span role="img" aria-label="sheep">😊</span>
     With Flipper I learnt about React components,
    lifecycle methods,stateless functional components and webpack to mention a few.

    It features account registration and some features of realword app like
    writing to a database and reading from it.<span role="img" aria-label="sheep">🤔</span>

    This is an Optical Character Recognition software interface
    that allows users to upload pictures to convert to text or capture with their webcam/mobile camera.<span role="img" aria-label="sheep">👁‍🗨</span>
    I built this with pure Html CSS and JavaScript. Then, I had no idea what frame works or libraries were, lol.
    <span role="img" aria-label="sheep">😂😭</span>
    it still has some bugs but I left them intentionally to know how far I've come

    Here is my first  personal website.<span role="img" aria-label="sheep">🤗🤗</span> I spent about a week building this with Bootstrap.
    <span role="img" aria-label="sheep">😉</span>
    Bootstrap made everything do easy, by just specifying a class on an element you could make it responsive.<span role="img" aria-label="sheep">😁</span>
    It was a chilling adventure but at a point I realized I couldn't do this myself without the help of Bootsrap.
    <span role="img" aria-label="sheep">☹</span>
    so I had to go back to learn CSS the hard way, and at the end, it paid off

     I built covid19-today during the coronavirus pandemic.<span role="img" aria-label="sheep">☹</span> As a developer at that time,
     one of the ways I could help people was provide them with relevant information.
     It displays data on the spread of the virus for all affected countries,<span role="img" aria-label="sheep">☹</span>
     with the country of the userscoming up first. Data provided include, daeth count, total confirmed cases<span role="img" aria-label="sheep">😢☹</span>
     total deaths, new cases and the likes.<br/><br/>
